Export Options

Export pixel art as PNG (with or without grid).

Export the reduced color palette as JSON / ASE / GIMP / Photoshop swatches.

Layer Panel

You have the internal foundation — a small UI for showing layers, toggling visibility, reordering.

Would make Pixelator feel like Photoshop for pixel art.

UI Polish

Add tooltips or a quick “?” help overlay explaining controls.

Keyboard shortcuts(B = brush, E = eraser, G = toggle grid).

	Sharability

“Share this pixelation” → generates a sharable link with params(tileSize = 12 & maxColors=16).

Or just allow exporting the session to JSON so users can reload projects.

	Embeddability

Small “Embed” button that gives people an < iframe > snippet.

Great for blogs, forums, or art communities.
